                        <h3>MRI Log File Data Mining</h3>
                        <p>
                            Data mining from MRI log files involves using machine learning methods to analyze time series data, particularly in identifying sequential patterns in long sequences of events. This is a challenging and often expensive task, but machine learning techniques can help identify patterns and understand complex relationships in the data. In a case study, we applied time-constrained Sequential Pattern Mining to analyze event clusters in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine log files. The study involved searching for clusters in the log data, and a critical analysis of the results obtained. We demonstrated the value of machine learning techniques in analyzing large data sets and identifying patterns that may not be immediately apparent through manual analysis. Through this project, we gained valuable experience in data mining, machine learning, and data analysis, which are essential skills in the field of data science.

                        <p>
                            Scraping in Real Estate is a project that I developed to collect property and consumer data from various online real estate websites. I utilized web scraping techniques to extract data such as property listings, location, price, and other relevant information. Additionally, I applied data analysis and other data science techniques to the collected data to derive insights such as market trends, consumer preferences, and optimal pricing strategies. The project required extensive knowledge of web scraping tools such as Beautiful Soup and Scrapy, as well as proficiency in programming languages such as Python and SQL for data cleaning and analysis. Through this project, I developed skills in data collection, web scraping, data analysis, and machine learning, all of which are critical for success in the field of data science. Additionally, I gained practical experience in applying these skills to real-world problems in the real estate industry.

The project involved daily automated access to this data and plotting real-time data from multiple countries on the same graph. By applying a 3rd degree polynomial function built from historical data of daily infections and deaths, the system estimated the number of daily COVID-19 infections and deaths. The project required proficiency in programming languages such as Python and data analysis tools such as Pandas and NumPy. Through this project, I further developed my skills in data science and analysis, as well as gaining practical experience in applying these skills to a real-world problem related to public health.

                        <h3>Intelligent Monitoring of Magnetic Resonance Equipment</h3>
                        <p>
                            During my time as a field engineer at GE Healthcare, I had the opportunity to lead the design and development of an intelligent monitoring system for magnetic resonance equipment. In this project, I used a camera and computer vision algorithms and pattern recognition to detect abnormal situations on the equipment's panel and automatically send email alerts. The implementation of the system involved the use of advanced image processing techniques such as segmentation and classification to detect faults or problems in real-time. This allowed for increased reliability and safety of magnetic resonance equipment, as well as improved monitoring efficiency. This experience allowed me to enhance my programming skills in C++ and Python, as well as computer vision and image processing. It was a unique opportunity to apply this knowledge in advanced technologies to practical and useful solutions.
